# Rhodes Island Story Logs
## LY3

### Story
Returning parallel story. Spot got the unbound rage, and Estelle got codependant. Spot is still lightly wound to its body and leg. 

** Getting back to the settlement, we see a new a strange person spinning up fabric. She offer to craft some stuff for us (Dark Seamstress). They trade her some acanthus for rawhide corset**

** The plague continues its damage on the settlement. Estelle is the only one that seems fine, the other 3 returning survivors are on death's door. Seeing this, the settlement get together and manage to use some component to innovate Ammonia. They spend 2 more endeavor to treat Zach and Spot. Courrier will unfortunately perish from the plague **

** The settlement decide to help Lapland to learn synch strike, to go out with Spot. They also craft a lot of new gear (luck charm, screaming helm, screaming coat, brain mint, dried acanthus). **

** Seeing the poor state of Courrier, the settlement decide to have a meeting about his state. He will not make it to the end of the year, and some of the pariah's idea are pretty tempting. They decide to draw a straw to know who will go out with Courrier to make a scab bow. Ferdinand is the unlucky volonteer. The pariah is smilling ear to ear, delighted at the chaos created by the ritual **


### Decision 

Innovating Ammonia came in clutch this year ! I managed to save 2 pretty decent survivor, and I also didn't roll another 1/2, so no more plague !!

The ressource spread is ass once again, but i got 2 more hide from people dying from plague on depart last year. I'm probably keeping those to make the lope set after the pariah showdown. 

Instead of letting Courrier die, i decided to turn him in a scab weapon. I could also just cure him, but I need sync strike on someone else this year. Hopefully the scab bow was worth loosing out on 2 death principle trigger. 

Trading in an useless ressource for a pelt with the parallel story was also super usefull to make a bit more armor. Also getting the rawhide corset might come in clutch. No armor on it suck, but if i can activate it for +1 evasion, it might be worth. I should be able to with the screaming helm and the lantern sword. 

I should have every departing survivor at 2 survival, a full rawhide set, some evasion, pretty good weapon, and a brain mint going into pariah. Hopefully it'll be enough, because i need to start rolling on augury next year, my pop is WAY down, and i don't think I can take the pariah punishment for long if i loose
