# Rhodes Island Story Logs
## LY2

### Story
** Once back to the settlement, some of the survivors seems sick (Plague) unfortunatly, it seem to be spreading, as Lucy and Kroos (our mere navi) dies from the illness. Hellagur and Erza also seem pretty sick and will probably die soon.**

** After tending to the sick, the settlement find a weird creature eating the corpse of the survivor that came from the sinkhole. They take pity to it. After getting acceptep in the settlement the Pariah offer its gift to the settlement, a weird lock of short brown hair **

** Not too long later, a weird knight come to the settlement. They shove a weird sword bundled with cloth in the hands of Zachary. They leave with unfinished business. **

** The setlement take the time to do their usual small ritual of trying to innovate. They discovered that their Inner lantern can be used to make them more active during combat **

** With the rest of the monster's part, the survivors get to crafting. They decide to finish some armor for someone, the mix the monster's organ with the one from the frogdog to make some grease, and they make cute earrings with the anteloppe bones. **

** Just as they are about to set out Hellagur and Erza also dies from the plague. **


### Decision 
Plague NOOOOO, 
We got plague for next year too... 2 died instantly, and 2 are dying at the end of the settlement phase.

I'm taking braal lock's. I'm tempted by the eye, but i don't want to risk a late TPK.

Hooded knight went pretty well, Zachary is a fine choice for the twillight sword i think. 

Innovate was between Inner Lantern and Song of the Brave. I went with lantern. Song of the brave is good, but passing up on inner lanter is rough if you can't get it later. Also character are cool. 

Finished up the rawhide set (with some hide from the deceased from plague), made some grease, so now i can have a tank.
I also made the bone earring. I'm not sure how long i'll use them, but for a couple year it might be usefull on the bone axe guy. 

I got 2 more hide from the 2 other survivor dying from the plague. i'll probably hunt an anteloppe and got for the screaming set next year.
