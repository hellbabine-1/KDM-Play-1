# Rhodes Island Hunting Logs  
## LY1

Just before we decided to go out again to try to get some more ressource for out settlement, one of the lantern in the big pile went out. Weird...

This expedition consist of Lucy, Spot, Kroos and Zachary. We got a bit of instanity from the previous year birth, and we're setting out with our new shinny gear

As soon as we set out, we find a weird pile of stone. Spot decided to climb on it, and it turned into some kind of moving stone, helping us to get on top of it. From that vantage point, we could clearly see the weird frogdog thing again near its lily pad and went directly to it (event 97 start the showdown immediatly)
