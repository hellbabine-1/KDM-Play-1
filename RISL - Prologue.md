# Rhodes Island Story Logs
## Prologue

### Story
*We've found a weird pile on lantern. For some reason this place feel safe. On our way here, we've encountered 8 other survivors wandering the dark and they came with us. We decided to name this place Rhodes Island, since it seems like this is how they call their home*

*With our own **language**, we can communicate with them, but we're too busy to ask all their name for now. Erza is gonna be responsible to watch those lantern to make sure there's nothing weird there.* 

*We are trying to make some weapon out of the bones of that monster, hopefully we can find another one of those monster to hunt soon*

*After telling what happened to our friend, we decided to just leave the deceased like that was a waste we couldn't afford. Next time, we getting some ressource out of them for sure*

### Decision 
We got the **fated** 8 survivor with us. Erza as been nominated for the +1 courage, +1 understanding from the returning survivor event. 

This run, I'm going with cannibalism. I rolled a 2 on the event, so we got back our spent founding stone, and some more insanity for our departing survivors. 

With only 1 hide, it would be pretty rough to innovate this year, but i'm still tempted. 

In the end, I decided to use the Wiry crest to craft the axe. 3/6/0 or 3/6/4 if insane seems pretty good, especially since lucy got 5 insanity. It also count as stinky for eprectophilia. 

With the rest, i'm crafting 1 long club, and a bone axe. No armor since we don't have any hide left. We're keeping the perfect bone and a spindly paw

The love juice got spend for some intimacy between 2 unamed survivor. Rolled a 7, so 2 unamed survivor are now at 2 survival, and we got a baby

This run i'm going with PtY. I want to try some savior stuff, and having a lot of population might benefit since we're running pariah. No reroll and no str/eva is hella scary tho. 

So I end up with 
2 max survival 
+1 pop (12 total)
1 bone axe, 1 long club, 1 crest axe, with a perfect bone and a spindly paw in storage.
