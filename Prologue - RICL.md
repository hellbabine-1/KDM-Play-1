# Rhodes Island Combat Logs  
## Prologue
Our 4 brave survivor (lucy, erza, zachary and Allister) went face to face with the prologue frogdog. 

After an uneventfull 2 turn, zachary got a crit that knocked down the dog, but gave it +2 toughness. Erza still tested her luck against it, and got 2 hit and 2 nines on her str dice roll.

The monster was almost dead without doing much damage, so I decided to stall a bit to get the death principle. Poor Alister died smelling something foul. 

All the stalling almost cost me another survivor, because for the next 2 round, no one got a hit in...

In the end, we got 3 victorious survivor, with zach having a Ruptured muscle on his arm, and Lucy got eprectophilia, and a bonus ressource from another crit. 

Final loot: Mammary gland (o), 2xSpindly paw (b), Wiry crest(h), Mossy molar(b), Love juice, Perfect bone, monster organ, monster bone, great cat bone
