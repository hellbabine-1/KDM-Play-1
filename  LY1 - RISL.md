### Story
** Once back to the settlement, our crew found a weird openning not far from the lanterns. They decided to go to the settlement to drop all their stuff, and get some help to investigate. They went back with a couple people to check the Open Maw in those stone faces. Shinning down the pit, they saw what look like the hilt of a sword. Exited by the prospect of more durable weapon, they decided to use most of the bones they got to make some makeshift footing to get in and out of that hole. Hellagur was the brave souls that went down there, and he manage to get the sword out int one piece. **

** They then went to check on Erza that stayed behind last year to check on the lantern horde. As she was about to speak, and  incredibly loud sound came from the darkness. Without skipping a beat, she went on about the need for survival of everybody and she became a quite good orator (of death) for the settlemnent. 

** Some time after coming back, Kroos began to develop a weird cough. She tried really hard to stop herself from coughing, but it wasn't a good idea, because when she couldn't hold it anymore, she coughed so hard she went blind in one eye... **

** The settlement decided to try something new this year, they managed to make some kind of instrument to use as a music instrument and learned how to use it (drum) **

** After all the severe injury suffered by the previous hunting party, they decided to use that little ressource they had left to start making some armor. They didn't get very far, but managed to make some glove out of rawhide. **

### Decision 
I got so much bone again... I decided to go with open maw to spend a lot of it to get something good, and it paid good. I rolled 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 5, 3, so after removing a 9 and the 3, i got 39, and managed to get the lantern sword. 

I used Erza for the enless scream, she got the orator of death, courage, and some insanity for our returning survivor. 

Kroos went in for the Mere navi from the Cough even, but ended up blind with a 2.

I made some rawhide armor, my only piece so far... I went with the glove since i don't have a way to activate the body nor the headband. 

Innovated between inner lantern and drum, i went with drum. Hopefully this doesn't bite me in the ass later, but i want some str from synch strike since i went with PtY. 

The last 2 endeavor will be used to give a pair of survivor synch strike. 

Probably hunting a lope next year.
