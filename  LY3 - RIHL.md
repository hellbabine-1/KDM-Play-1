# Rhodes Island Hunting Logs  
## LY3

This year's expedition consist of Spot, Zachary, Courrier and Estelle. Everyone get some understanding from the pariah as he share some of his knowledge with the departing survivors. This year target is another anteloppe. 

Courrier got his cloth and a lantern sword.
Estelle got the rawhide set, the grease and a crest axe (and no insanity)
Zach has the twillight sword, dormant twillight cloak, blue lantern, cloth and the long club as a backup
Spot is going in feral mode, with bone earrings and a bone axe, otherwise naked. 

Starting their journey, they encounter a field of acanthus. They could use it to heal, but no one has been hurt so far, so they continue along. (Grazing field, need to roll a random event)

When exiting the acanthus field, they end up in some heavy mist, making it hard to find the right direction. They get lucky and just wander in the right direction (event 39)

Strong wind start to blow their way, but nothing happens (event 58, rolled a 2 so the monster get closer.)

They encounter their quarry. 

## Note

Fast hunt, we like this !
