# Rhodes Island Combat Logs  
## LY2

The Anteloppe start the showdown, and instantly goes to eat some grass (crush&devour with no one in range turned to graze)

Erza spotted a small hole next to her with a baby frogdog in there. Reaching in, she managed to grab some weird organ (+1 copper)
Spot threw out his founding stone, wounding the monster, getting some of its pelt out of it, and making it less menacing (-1 dmg token)
The other survivors cautiously move out of range from the monster. 

The monster moves in to try and bite Zachary, but doesn't quite reach him. 

Using his long club, Zachary goes on the counter attack. Its super effective. The monster get knocked down thank to a lucky crit with the bonus luck from the HL. Spot goes in with its crested axe, but the monster start screaming loudly with its undermaw and start running around. Spot get knocked back, and Erza get hit by the monster movement (get Anhedonia). Hellagur start running with its friend toward the acanthus. 

The Monster after recovering from its freakout decide to just go Chow Down on some grass (rolle an 8, so it healed all it wound...)

Seeing this, Erza decide to also throw her precious stone, crushing the monster's knee (roll on movement, on 1 monster is knocked down). Spot moves in getting a couple hit on the monster and with a crit to the restless ear, dazzes it. It then got kick really hard in the waist and fell back further. Zachary and hellagur are too far from the monster, so they start collecting some Acanthus. Only hellagur managed to get anything. 

The monster start to Stomp and Snort in place. Hellagur seem really affected and get knocked down. 

Pretty uneventfull turn for the survivor, Hellagur is still down, everyone else try to attack with low success (2hit total, 1 wound)

The monster start running around. It then turn to look at Hellagur still knocked down and try to Run Down on him. Fortunatly Zachary is there to encourage Hellagur to mitigate the speed the monster was building up. 

Erza run to the bug she spoted near her and get a CrabSpider. Hellagur finally get to swing its new lantern sword, only to immediatly lost his balance due to its weight, and miss all his attack. Spot miss all his attack, and Zachary managed to get 1 wound in 

The monster start to Stomp around once again. Fortunatly, Erza doesn't seem to mind, even if the monster is looking straight at her. 

Hellagur goes to the monster blind spot and swing its sword again. This time it connect, and does 2 wound before the monster run him over (cancelling a REALLY bad reaction). Erza and Zachary are still in range to attack the monster and they do so, with once again not great success. Spot is to farm away so he gather some herb, but can't find anything there.

The monster seem dazed and just start running away. 

The survivors are too far to do anything, they're trying to catch up with the monster. Spot try to get some herbs again, but doesn't fing anything usable. 

The monster continue to stand its ground and seem to only Stom and Snort. Erza is still the victim, and suffer lunacy from it, gaining Monster panic. 

Finally, Zachary and Hellagur finish off the monster. 

Erza doesn't get anything from age 1 because of anhedonia
Spot got orator of death from age 1

We get 2xLarge flat tooth(b), 2xpelt(h), 1x shank bone(b), 1x muscly gums(o), 1 crab spider(h), 1 acanthus, 2 monsterbone, 1monster hide, 1 monster organ, 1x Burnished Encephalomatter(c, o)


### Note 
Didn't get hit too much, which was nice because i only have 1 guy with rawhide glove and cloth as armor... 
Poor Hellagur with its lantern sword didn't do great hit wise, at least they were all wound.
