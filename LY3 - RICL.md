### Note 
The showdown was pretty easy, i got a LOT of hits with spot. Bones earring are pretty dang good. Even after getting his bone axe eaten, he went to town with a lot of f&t wound, with only 3 str (1 from stat, 2 from token)

The loot this year is horrible once again, even with 2 extra ressource drop, i've got 1 hide, that i'll need to use to get amonia if i want to survive plague. o7
