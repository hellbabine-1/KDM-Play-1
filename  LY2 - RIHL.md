# Rhodes Island Hunting Logs  
## LY2

This year's expedition consist of Spot, Erza, Zachary and Hellabur. No departing bonus this year

Our hunting party can see far away in the distance some scream getting further and further away (Migration Antelope event)

This move kinda confused our party, and they immediatly got lost (event 37)

Going toward their destination, they need to move across a river. While crossing, Zachary hurt his on some rock. On the other side everyone else instantly found the monster's trail (event 46, 3 survivors rolled a 10 oO)

Next, they encountered a statue with one eye and six hand. There was a sword laying in front of it, but no one tried to get it, the party has enough weapon as is (event 88)

The survivor found some strange marks on the ground. After some investigating, Erza scraped her arm against some stone, and spot found an anteloppe tooth. (anteloppe teething)

Next to those marks, they found a scene looking a lot like their first hunt. They are invigored by it (event 91, no other bonus from innovation). 

Suddenly, a huge sinkhole appear under the feet of Spot and Zachary. Zach lost his precious founding stone while getting rescued, and went to help the other rescue Spot. After a lot of effort, a second survivor holding onto Spot came out of the hole ! Weirded out, they watch them go back to their settlement. (even sinkhole, 2 straggler, rolled a 3 and a 10)

They now must cross the Overwhelming Darkness
Spot rolled on the path of the insane, and got a 3(lost all survival)
Erza rolled on the path of the doomed (lost half her survival and got ptsd)
Zachary rolled on the path of the doomed (+1 insanity, +1 courage)
Hellagur rolled on the path of the doomed (lost half his survival and got a -1 evasion token)

Our hunting party finally found their quarry
